            <div class="answer">
                <p>There are two common ways to add ether to your wallet.
</p>
                <br>
                <p>1.The most common way is to buy Ether through an exchange such as Coinbase, Bitstamp or similar. As soon as that is done, transfer the funds to your MetaMask or Mist wallet using the
wallet in the exchange of your choice.<br>
                2.You can also buy ether directly in MetaMask. This, however, is only possible for US citizens.</p>

                <p>If you already own Ether you can transfer funds directly to your MetaMask or Mist wallet by copying the wallet address. In the exchange wallt you then simply paste that address and send
the funds.</p>
